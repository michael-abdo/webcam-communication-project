### 3. Validate Your Deployment
```bash
# Replace with your actual URL
python3 validate_live_deployment.py https://your-app.railway.app
```

### 4. Test with ChatGPT
Share this with ChatGPT:
```
I have deployed a Fatigue Detection API at: https://your-app.railway.app

Test all endpoints:
- GET /health
- GET /api/info
- GET /api/metrics
- POST /api/analyze (body: {"perclos": 0.25, "confidence": 0.95})
```
